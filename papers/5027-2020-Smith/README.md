# Raising the Bar! Developing world-class reports with SAS Visual Analytics                                   

BarChartD3.html is the D3 graph that uses hard coded data. This will work outside of SAS Visual Analytics.
BarChartD3VA.html has been modified to work with the Data-Driven Content object in SAS Visual Analytics. This should be saved on your SAS Viya server in the folder /var/www/html.

Note: These examples will not work in Internet Explorer, the reccomended browser to use is Chrome.
