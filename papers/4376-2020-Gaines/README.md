# Tips for Writing Custom SAS&reg; Studio Tasks That Use CAS Actions for Advanced Analytics                        ## Supplementary materialsTo follow along with the paper and use the following materials, you need access to a SAS&reg; Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) server that has a license for [SAS&reg; Econometrics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/econometrics.html).  For more information on free software trials of SAS Viya, visit the [SAS Trials website](https://www.sas.com/en_us/trials.html).### Data* gnpHamilton.sas	* Code to create the MYCAS.GNPHAMILTON data table used in Example 2 in the paper.  	* This code is borrowed with permission from [Example 13.3 in the HMM procedure documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=casecon&docsetVersion=8.5&docsetTarget=casecon_hmm_examples11.htm&locale=en).### Task code* stateIndependent.xml	* Task code to add the "State independent parameters" options from Example 2 to your custom task.  * ViyaHiddenMarkovModels.xml	* Updated version of the Hidden Markov Models task with the new features described in the paper for both Examples 1 and 2.  	* The focus of the paper is to add these new features for PROC CAS code generation, but this version of the task also includes these features for PROC HMM code generation for completeness.## Additional informationThe full paper is available online in the [SAS Global Forum proceedings](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/proceedings.html).
