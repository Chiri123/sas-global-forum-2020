# Customize Your Table of Contents with the ODS Destination For WORD                                                              

The Base SAS® Output Delivery System (ODS) destination for Word enables customers to deliver SAS® reports as native Microsoft Word documents.  ODS WORD generates reports in the Office Open XML Document (.docx) format, which has been standard in Microsoft Word since 2007. The .docx format uses ZIP compression, which makes for a smaller storage footprint and speedier downloading.  ODS WORD  is preproduction in the sixth maintenance release of SAS 9.4.

This paper shows you how to make a custom table of contents (TOC) with ODS WORD.  You will learn how to control the placement, text, and style of your TOC.  Place your TOC anywhere in the body of your document.  Make your TOC title and entry text anything you want it to be.  Assign custom colors or fonts to your TOC text.  Even put a stylish border around your TOC if you like!  Adding a TOC to your document makes it more navigable, whether it is in digital or hard-copy format. Adding a custom TOC makes your document smarter, which makes you look smarter too!  Whatever your SAS programming experience level may be, you will benefit from this session.
