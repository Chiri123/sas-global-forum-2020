# 10 Minutes to Your First Hello World  Rest APIs                                                             

Like many other software applications, your time to first Hello World (TtFHW) with the SAS® Viya® REST APIs should be seamless and simple. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate with a standard workflow that the SAS Viya playbook works out of the box. Then, once you have used the playbook, you’ll be enabled to envision how you can extend it for your use cases. The playbook uses standard Python modules to connect to the SAS Viya REST APIs and is designed with easy to read variable declarations and helper functions for ease of use. The GitHub project includes all dependencies and is designed to work with SAS Viya 3.4 or 3.5.

The attached [TtFHW playbook](4278_TenMinutesToYourFirstHelloWorld_REST-APIs_SGF2020.ipynb) is designed to work with SAS Viya 3.4 or 3.5, and it requires minimal Python packages.

Please see the playbook or the paper for usage information.
