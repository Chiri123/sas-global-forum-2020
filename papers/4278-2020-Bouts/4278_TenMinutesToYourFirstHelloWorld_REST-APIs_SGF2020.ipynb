    "# This Notebook Supports the SGF2020 Presentation:\n",
    "## 4278_TenMinutesToYourFirstHelloWorld_REST-APIs_SGF2020\n",
    "### ** include link when available**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "By executing the following playbook, you will create a standard Analytical Base Table (ABT) and promote the ABT so that it can be used in other SAS Viya applications:\n",
    "- Process and prepare the Water_Cluster dataset from the samples CAS library\n",
    " - The Water_Cluster dataset contains data on home water consumption and is used in example [Visual Analytics reports](https://go.documentation.sas.com/api/docsets/viyaov/3.5/content/viyaov.pdf) \n",
    "- Run SAS DataStep to add an indicator variable by calling the RunCode action\n",
    "- Aggregate the dataset with the equivalent of proc means, then promote the ABT to be used by other SAS Viya applications\n",
    " - This playbook is used to demonstrate a generally accepted practice in order to prepare an Analytical Base Table (ABT)\n",
    " - Analysts typically denormalize the data and create statistically relevant columns when creating an ABT\n",
    " - The resulting ABT can then be used for subsequent analysis and modeling in SAS Viya\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Disclaimer:\n",
    "The suggested steps in this playbook are not exhaustive around creating an ABT; your individual requirements may require more or less work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the following cells; making any changes as you see fit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "- [SAS Viya 3.4 or 3.5](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya.html)\n",
    "- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/), note that all developed was performed with 3.7.4\n",
    "- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) {Hub | Lab | Notebook} is recommended but not required\n",
    "- [Python requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)\n",
    "- [Python json package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)\n",
    "- [Python pandas package](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "- [Python getpass package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html)\n",
    "- Git, in order to [clone the project](https://github.com/sascommunities/sas-global-forum-2020/tree/master/papers/4278-2020-Bouts)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supporting Documentation:\n",
    "- Information supporting CAS REST APIs can be found at [developer.sas.com](https://developer.sas.com/guides/restapis/cas-rest.html)\n",
    "- Information supporting the CAS Action Sets behind the CAS REST APIs can be found in the following two locations:\n",
    " - The [SAS® Viya® 3.5: System Programming Guide](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=9.4_3.5&docsetId=caspg&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&locale=en)\n",
    " - The [SAS® Viya® 3.5 Actions and Action Sets by Name and Product](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmcdc&cdcVersion=8.11&docsetId=allprodsactions&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&locale=en)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essential Preparation:\n",
    "- Reference [this blog for instructions on how to configure the client secrets](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2019/01/25/authentication-to-sas-viya/)\n",
    "- Work with your SAS Environment Administrator to setup the appropriate client secret(s)"
