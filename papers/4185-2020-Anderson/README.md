# Creating Custom Web Applications with SAS® Viya® Jobs                                

In prior versions of SAS®, an oft-overlooked capability was using SAS® Stored Processes to stream HTML content and essentially create full-blown web applications that take advantage of the SAS® Platform. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SAS code, the possibilities were endless. From workflow, to data entry, to geographic mapping applications—if you could envision it, you could probably build it with SAS Stored Processes. 

With the introduction of SAS® Viya®, the concept of SAS Stored Processes was initially sunset. Thankfully, the SAS® Job Execution Web Application enables much of the same custom application development functionality that SAS Stored Processes did, while enabling you to leverage the full power of SAS Viya. Whether you're familiar with the old approach based on SAS Stored Processes or not, this breakout session shows you the easiest ways to leverage SAS and HTML with SAS Job Execution Web Application. 

The agenda for this session includes the following topics: what a SAS Viya job is; how to create and register a job in SAS® Studio; how to associate a form with a job for parameter selection; incorporating HTML into your job; and creating a full-blown web application by using jobs.

## Additional information

The code examples provided can be run in your enviroment with minimal modifications. Define each program as a Job in SAS Studio and specify the parameters as noted in the header for each. 

The examples are divided into two separate folders:

Fundamentals - Explains the basics of web-based Job creation in 4 separate programs. Follow these examples along with the paper to learn the fundementals before continuing.

Car Application - Define these 5 programs in order as Jobs. You'll need to make changes specific to your Viya environment.
