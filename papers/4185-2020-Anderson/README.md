# Creating Custom Web Applications with SAS® Viya® Jobs                                

The code examples provided can be run in your enviroment with minimal modifications. Define each program as a Job in SAS Studio and specify the parameters as noted in the header for each. 

The examples are divided into two separate folders:

Fundamentals - Explains the basics of web-based Job creation in 4 separate programs. Follow these examples along with the paper to learn the fundementals before continuing.

Car Application - Define these 5 programs in order as Jobs. You'll need to make changes specific to your Viya environment.
