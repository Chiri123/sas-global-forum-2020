# The SAS Hash Object: A Deeper And Wider Look At The Fundamentals And Functionality

This zip file contains the programs from Part II of the 2020 SAS Global Forum tutorial _The SAS Hash Object: A Deeper And Wider Look At The Fundamentals And Functionality_ that was included in Season 3 of the Virtual Conference.

As mentioned in the video, please follow the simple instructions to create the sample data [included in Allan Bowe's GitHub project](https://github.com/allanbowe/BizarroBall/blob/master/README.md).

Assuming that you used the default settings, three folders were created for the sample data. The autoexec.sas file included in this zip file will define the needed libnames to allow the sample programs to run.

If you have any questions for either Paul Dorfman or Don Henderson, the easiest way to reach us is to post a question at http://communities.sas.com and tag one or both of us (@hashman for Paul and @DonH for Don).

Also please make sure to leverage the additional content we have created at communities.sas.com using the search term DMHashBook (not case sensitive).
