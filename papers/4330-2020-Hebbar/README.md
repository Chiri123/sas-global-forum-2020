# Expressions in Graph Template Language and Other Tips                                                       

This paper is a reprise of the SASÂ® Global Forum 2013 paper "Free Expressions and Other GTL Tips". The Graph Template Language (GTL) provides many powerful features for creating versatile graphs. The statistical graphics capability in GTL lets you use expressions directly in the templates to simply data preparation. This presentation covers some ways of using DATA step functions to create grouped plots based on conditions and to select a subset of the observations.

It also illustrates usage of FCMP procedure functions in GTL expressions. Tips on using non-breaking space for creating "chunked" graphs and indenting text are discussed. Workarounds for rendering Unicode characters using data column variables are also discussed.
